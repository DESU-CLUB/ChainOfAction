Based on the steps provided, here is the Python code for the "Add Binary" problem:

```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Initialize a result string and a carry variable.
        result = ""
        carry = 0
        
        # Step 2: Align the binary strings by prepending zeros to the shorter string.
        max_length = max(len(a), len(b))
        a = a.zfill(max_length)
        b = b.zfill(max_length)
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over the aligned strings from right to left.
        for i in range(max_length - 1, -1, -1):
            # Step 4: For each pair of digits, compute the sum including the carry.
            total = carry
            total += int(a[i]) + int(b[i])
            
            # Step 5: Update the result with the sum modulo 2.
            result = str(total % 2) + result
            
            # Step 6: Update the carry with the sum divided by 2.
            carry = total // 2
        
        # Step 7: If there's a carry left after the loop, prepend it to the result.
        if carry:
            result = "1" + result
        
        # Step 8: Return the result string.
        return result
```

This code should work correctly for the "Add Binary" problem on LeetCode when submitted.
