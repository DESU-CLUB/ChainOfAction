As per your request, here is the Python code based on the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Step 1: Initialize a variable to keep track of the current index in the string.
        current_index = 0
        
        # Convert the string to a list to allow modification
        s_list = list(s)
        
        # Step 2: Loop over the string while the current index is less than the string's length.
        while current_index < len(s_list):
            # Step 2a: Identify the substring that needs to be reversed.
            # Step 2b: Reverse the identified substring.
            # Step 2c: Concatenate the reversed substring with the rest of the string.
            s_list[current_index:current_index+k] = reversed(s_list[current_index:current_index+k])
            
            # Step 2d: Increment the current index by 2k to move to the next segment.
            current_index += 2 * k
        
        # Step 3: Return the modified string as the final result.
        return ''.join(s_list)
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `reverseStr` that takes a string `s` and an integer `k` and returns the modified string according to the problem statement.
