Here is the Python code based on the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Convert wordDict to a set for efficient lookups.
        word_set = set(wordDict)
        
        # Step 2: Initialize a boolean list dp with length s + 1, setting dp[0] to True.
        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        
        # Step 3: Loop over the string from index 1 to len(s).
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            # Step 4: For each index, check all possible substrings ending at the current index.
            for j in range(i):
                # Step 5: If a valid substring is found and dp at the start of the substring is True, set dp at the current index to True.
                if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_set:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        
        # Step 6: Return the value of dp at the last index.
        return dp[len(s)]
```

Please ensure that you have the correct imports at the beginning of your code file:

```python
from typing import List
```

This code snippet defines the `Solution` class with the `wordBreak` method, which takes a string `s` and a list of strings `wordDict` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. The method uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
