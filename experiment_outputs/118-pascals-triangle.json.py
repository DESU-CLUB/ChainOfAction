I will provide you with the Python code based on the steps you've identified:

```python
class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        if numRows == 0:
            return []
        
        # Step 1: Initialize an empty list to hold the rows of Pascal's triangle.
        pascal_triangle = []
        
        # Step 2: Loop from 1 to numRows to generate each row of the triangle.
        for i in range(numRows):
            # Step 3: For each row, initialize a new list with a leading 1.
            row = [1]
            
            # Step 4: Populate the current row by adding the appropriate elements from the previous row.
            if i > 0:
                for j in range(1, i):
                    row.append(pascal_triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + pascal_triangle[i - 1][j])
            
            # Step 5: Append a 1 to the end of the current row if it's not the first row.
            if i > 0:
                row.append(1)
            
            # Step 6: Add the current row to the list of rows.
            pascal_triangle.append(row)
        
        # Step 7: Return the list of rows after the loop ends.
        return pascal_triangle
```

Please note that the `List` type hint should be imported from the `typing` module if you are using a version of Python that is earlier than 3.9. For Python 3.9 and later, you can use the built-in `list` type hint directly. Here's how you would import it for earlier versions:

```python
from typing import List
```
