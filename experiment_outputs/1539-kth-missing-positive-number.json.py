Based on the steps provided, here is the Python code for the `findKthPositive` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # 1: Initialize a variable to track the current positive integer.
        current = 1
        
        # 2: Initialize a variable to count the number of missing integers.
        missing_count = 0
        
        # 3: Loop through the positive integers starting from 1.
        while True:
            # 4: Check if the current integer is missing from the array.
            if current not in arr:
                # 5: If missing, increment the missing count.
                missing_count += 1
                
                # 6: If the missing count equals k, return the current integer.
                if missing_count == k:
                    return current
            
            # 7: Increment the current integer and continue the loop.
            current += 1
```

Please note that the provided code is a direct translation of the steps into Python and may not be the most efficient solution for the problem. It uses a linear search to check if the current integer is missing from the array, which could be optimized further.
