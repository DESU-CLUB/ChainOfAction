As per your request, here is the Python code that follows the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxScoreSightseeingPair(self, values: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum score.
        max_score = 0
        
        # Step 2: Initialize a variable to keep track of the best value found so far adjusted for the distance.
        best_value_so_far = values[0] + 0  # Since i = 0 for the first element
        
        # Step 3: Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
        for j in range(1, len(values)):
            # Step 4: Update the maximum score by comparing it with the sum of the current value and the best value found so far.
            max_score = max(max_score, best_value_so_far + values[j] - j)
            
            # Step 5: Update the best value found so far by comparing it with the current value adjusted for the distance.
            best_value_so_far = max(best_value_so_far, values[j] + j)
        
        # Step 6: Return the maximum score after completing the iteration.
        return max_score
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `maxScoreSightseeingPair` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots as per the problem statement. The code follows the steps outlined in your request to solve the problem.
