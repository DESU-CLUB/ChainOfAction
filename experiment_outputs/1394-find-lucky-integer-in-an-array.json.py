As per your request, here is the Python code using the function head provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create a frequency map for all elements in the array.
        frequency_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            frequency_map[num] = frequency_map.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        # Step 2 and 3: Iterate through the frequency map to find all lucky integers and identify the largest.
        max_lucky = -1
        for num, freq in frequency_map.items():
            if num == freq:
                max_lucky = max(max_lucky, num)
        
        # Step 4: Return the largest lucky integer or -1 if none exist.
        return max_lucky
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `findLucky` that takes a list of integers `arr` and returns an integer. The method follows the steps you've outlined to find the largest lucky integer in the array.
