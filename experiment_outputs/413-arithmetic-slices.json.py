Based on the steps provided, here is the Python code for the problem:

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Initialize a counter for the number of arithmetic slices to zero.
        count = 0
        
        # Step 2: Iterate through the array with an index variable starting from zero.
        for i in range(len(A) - 2):
            # Step 3: For each index, check if a valid arithmetic slice can be formed with the next two elements.
            diff = A[i + 1] - A[i]
            j = i + 2
            
            # Step 4: If a valid slice is found, increment the counter and expand the slice while the difference remains constant.
            while j < len(A) and A[j] - A[j - 1] == diff:
                count += 1
                j += 1
        
        # Step 5: Return the counter as the final result.
        return count
```

This code snippet follows the steps you've outlined and should work correctly to solve the problem as per the given constraints.
