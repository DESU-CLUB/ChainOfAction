Based on the steps provided, here is the Python code for the Beautiful Arrangement problem:

```python
class Solution:
    def countArrangement(self, n: int) -> int:
        def dfs(nums: list, i: int = 1):
            # Step 2: If the current position is greater than n, increment the result counter.
            if i > n:
                self.result += 1
                return
            # Step 3: Iterate over the remaining numbers.
            for k in range(len(nums)):
                # Step 4: For each number, check if it can be placed at the current position.
                if nums[k] % i == 0 or i % nums[k] == 0:
                    # Step 5: If the number is valid, recursively call the function with the next position and updated remaining numbers.
                    dfs(nums[:k] + nums[k+1:], i + 1)
        
        self.result = 0
        # Step 1: Define a function to count beautiful arrangements with parameters for the current position and the remaining numbers.
        dfs(list(range(1, n + 1)))
        # Step 6: Return the result counter after all permutations are checked.
        return self.result
```

This code snippet defines a class `Solution` with a method `countArrangement` that uses a helper function `dfs` to recursively count the number of beautiful arrangements. The `dfs` function checks if the current number can be placed at the current position according to the problem's criteria and then proceeds to the next position with the remaining numbers. The result is stored in the `self.result` variable, which is returned at the end.
