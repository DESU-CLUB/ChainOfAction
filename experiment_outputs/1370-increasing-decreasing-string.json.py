It seems there was a misunderstanding. The provided code snippets are not relevant to the problem at hand. Let's write the correct Python code for the problem described, following the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Create a frequency map for characters in the string.
        frequency = {}
        for char in s:
            frequency[char] = frequency.get(char, 0) + 1

        # Step 2: Sort the unique characters in ascending order.
        unique_chars = sorted(frequency.keys())

        # Step 3: Initialize an empty result string.
        result = []

        # Step 4: While there are characters left to append:
        while frequency:
            # a. Append characters in ascending order based on frequency map.
            for char in unique_chars:
                if char in frequency:
                    result.append(char)
                    frequency[char] -= 1
                    if frequency[char] == 0:
                        del frequency[char]

            # b. Append characters in descending order based on frequency map.
            for char in reversed(unique_chars):
                if char in frequency:
                    result.append(char)
                    frequency[char] -= 1
                    if frequency[char] == 0:
                        del frequency[char]

        # Step 5: Return the result string.
        return ''.join(result)
```
