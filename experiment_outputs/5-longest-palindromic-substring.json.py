Here is the Python code based on the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Initialize variables to store the start and length of the longest palindrome found.
        start, max_length = 0, 0

        # Step 2: Create a helper function to expand around the center of a palindrome.
        def expand_around_center(left, right):
            while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
                left -= 1
                right += 1
            return left + 1, right - 1

        # Step 3: Loop through the string to use each character as the center of potential palindromes.
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Step 4: Use the helper function to check for palindromes with odd lengths.
            left, right = expand_around_center(i, i)
            if right - left + 1 > max_length:
                start, max_length = left, right - left + 1

            # Step 5: Use the helper function to check for palindromes with even lengths.
            left, right = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)
            if right - left + 1 > max_length:
                start, max_length = left, right - left + 1

        # Step 7: Return the substring from the start position with the length of the longest palindrome found.
        return s[start:start + max_length]
```

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `longestPalindrome` that takes a string `s` and returns the longest palindromic substring within `s`. The method uses a helper function `expand_around_center` to find palindromes by expanding around the center of the string. It checks for both odd and even length palindromes and updates the start and length of the longest palindrome found. Finally, it returns the longest palindromic substring.
