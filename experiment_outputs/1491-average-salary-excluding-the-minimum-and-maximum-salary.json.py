Here's the Python code based on the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def average(self, salary: List[int]) -> float:
        # 1: Identify the minimum and maximum values in the salary array.
        min_salary = min(salary)
        max_salary = max(salary)
        
        # 2: Sum all values in the salary array excluding the identified minimum and maximum.
        total_salary = sum(salary) - min_salary - max_salary
        
        # 3: Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count of salaries excluding the two extremes.
        average_salary = total_salary / (len(salary) - 2)
        
        # 4: Return the calculated average.
        return average_salary
```

This code snippet defines a class `Solution` with a method `average` that takes a list of integers `salary` and returns a float representing the average salary excluding the minimum and maximum salary. The steps are implemented in the order given, using built-in Python functions `min`, `max`, and `sum`. The average is calculated by subtracting the minimum and maximum salary from the total sum and then dividing by the number of remaining salaries.
