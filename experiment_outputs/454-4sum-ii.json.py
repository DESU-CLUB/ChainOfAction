As per your request, here is the Python code based on the steps provided:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def fourSumCount(self, A: List[int], B: List[int], C: List[int], D: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create a hash map to store the sum of pairs from A and B and their frequencies.
        sum_ab = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Step 2: Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of tuples.
        count = 0
        
        # Generate all possible sums of pairs from A and B and store them in the hash map.
        for a in A:
            for b in B:
                sum_ab[a + b] += 1
        
        # Step 3: Iterate through all pairs of C and D.
        for c in C:
            for d in D:
                # Step 4: For each pair, calculate the complement of their sum to zero.
                complement = -(c + d)
                
                # Step 5 & 6: Check if the complement exists in the hash map and increment the counter.
                count += sum_ab[complement]
        
        # Step 7: Return the counter as the final result.
        return count
```

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `fourSumCount` that takes four lists of integers as input and returns the number of tuples that sum up to zero. The code follows the steps outlined in your request to solve the problem.
