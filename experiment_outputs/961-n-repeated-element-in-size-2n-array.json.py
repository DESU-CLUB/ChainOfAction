As per your request, I will provide the Python code based on the steps identified:

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedNTimes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Iterate through the array A.
        # Step 2: Create a data structure to keep track of the count of each element.
        count_dict = {}
        
        # Step 3: Update the count for each element encountered during iteration.
        for num in nums:
            if num in count_dict:
                count_dict[num] += 1
            else:
                count_dict[num] = 1
            
            # Step 4: Check if the count of the current element reaches N.
            # Step 5: If the count is N, return the current element as the result.
            if count_dict[num] > 1:
                return num
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `repeatedNTimes` that takes a list of integers `nums` and returns the integer that is repeated `N` times in the array. The code follows the steps you provided to solve the problem.
