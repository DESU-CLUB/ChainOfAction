Here is the Python code based on the steps provided, using the function head you've given:

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Sort the target array.
        target.sort()
        
        # Step 2: Sort the arr array.
        arr.sort()
        
        # Step 3: Compare the sorted arrays for equality.
        # Step 4: Return the result of the comparison.
        return target == arr
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `canBeEqual` that takes two lists of integers `target` and `arr` and returns a boolean. The method follows the steps you've outlined to determine if one array can be made equal to another by reversing sub-arrays.
