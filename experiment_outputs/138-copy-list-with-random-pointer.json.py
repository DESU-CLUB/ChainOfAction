It seems like you're asking for Python code to implement the steps provided for the problem of copying a list with a random pointer. Below is the Python code that follows the steps you've outlined:

```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not head:
            return None
        
        # Step 1: Create a dictionary to map original nodes to their clones.
        clone_map = {}
        
        # Step 2: Iterate over the original list, cloning nodes and populating the dictionary.
        current = head
        while current:
            clone_map[current] = Node(current.val)
            current = current.next
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over the original list again to assign next and random pointers to cloned nodes.
        current = head
        while current:
            if current.next:
                clone_map[current].next = clone_map[current.next]
            if current.random:
                clone_map[current].random = clone_map[current.random]
            current = current.next
        
        # Step 4: Return the head of the cloned list.
        return clone_map[head]
```

This code defines a `Solution` class with a method `copyRandomList` that takes the head of a linked list as input and returns a deep copy of the list. The `Node` class is used to represent each node in the linked list. The method follows the steps you've provided to create a deep copy of the list with all the `next` and `random` pointers correctly assigned.
