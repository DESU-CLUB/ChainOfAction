It seems there was a misunderstanding. The provided code snippets and function heads are not related to the "Plus One" problem. Let me provide you with the correct Python code for the "Plus One" problem based on the steps you've given:

```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Iterate over the array of digits in reverse order.
        for i in range(len(digits) - 1, -1, -1):
            # Step 2: Increment the last digit by one.
            digits[i] += 1
            # Step 3: Check for carry and adjust the current digit and the carry accordingly.
            if digits[i] < 10:
                return digits
            digits[i] = 0
        # Step 4: If there is a carry after the last iteration, prepend 1 to the array.
        return [1] + digits
```

Please replace `List[int]` with the appropriate import statement `from typing import List` at the beginning of your code file if you are using a version of Python that requires it. This code should correctly solve the "Plus One" problem as per the given steps.
