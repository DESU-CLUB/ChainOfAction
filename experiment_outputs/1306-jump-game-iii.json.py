Here is the Python code that follows the given steps:

```python
class Solution:
    def canReach(self, arr: List[int], start: int) -> bool:
        visited = set()  # Step 2

        def dfs(index):  # Step 3
            # Step 4: Check for base cases
            if index < 0 or index >= len(arr) or index in visited:
                return False
            if arr[index] == 0:
                return True
            
            visited.add(index)  # Step 5
            
            # Step 6: Recursively call DFS for possible jumps
            return dfs(index + arr[index]) or dfs(index - arr[index])
        
        # Step 7: Return the result of the DFS call
        return dfs(start)
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `canReach` that takes an array `arr` and an integer `start` as input. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine if it's possible to reach an index with value 0 by jumping to indices `i + arr[i]` or `i - arr[i]`. The `visited` set is used to keep track of indices that have already been checked to avoid infinite loops. The `dfs` function is a recursive function that performs the DFS and returns `True` if an index with value 0 is found, and `False` otherwise.
