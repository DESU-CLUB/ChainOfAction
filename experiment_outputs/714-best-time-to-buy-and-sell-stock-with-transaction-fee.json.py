As per your request, I will only provide the Python code for the steps you've identified without any additional explanation. Here's the code:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        # 1: Initialize variables to track cash and hold
        cash, hold = 0, -prices[0]
        
        # 2: Iterate through the price array
        for price in prices:
            # 3: Calculate the maximum cash and hold values considering the transaction fee
            cash = max(cash, hold + price - fee)
            hold = max(hold, cash - price)
        
        # 4: Return the maximum cash value after the last day as the maximum profit
        return cash
```
