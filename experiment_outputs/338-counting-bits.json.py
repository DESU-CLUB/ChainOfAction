As per your request, here is the Python code following the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Initialize an array to store the count of 1's for each number.
        counts = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Step 2: Loop through the range from 0 to num.
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Step 3: For each number, calculate the number of 1's in its binary representation.
            # This uses the fact that i & (i - 1) drops the lowest set bit, so counts[i] = counts[i & (i - 1)] + 1
            counts[i] = counts[i & (i - 1)] + 1
        
        # Step 5: Return the array with counts.
        return counts
```

This code snippet follows the steps you've outlined and solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, as required by the follow-up challenge. It uses dynamic programming to build up the solution, leveraging the relationship between the binary representations of the numbers i and i & (i - 1).
