Here is the Python code based on the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def balancedString(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Step 1: Calculate the target frequency for each character.
        target = len(s) // 4
        
        # Step 2: Count the current frequency of each character in the string.
        count = collections.Counter(s)
        
        # Step 3: Initialize variables for the sliding window's start and end pointers, and the minimum substring length.
        start = 0
        min_length = len(s)
        
        # Step 4: Expand the sliding window by moving the end pointer and updating character frequencies.
        for end in range(len(s)):
            count[s[end]] -= 1
            
            # Step 5: When a character exceeds the target frequency, contract the window from the start and update the minimum substring length.
            while all(count[char] <= target for char in 'QWER'):
                min_length = min(min_length, end - start + 1)
                count[s[start]] += 1
                start += 1
        
        # Step 7: Return the minimum substring length.
        return min_length
```

Please note that you need to import the `collections` module for the `Counter` class to work. Add `import collections` at the beginning of your script.
