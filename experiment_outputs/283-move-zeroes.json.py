As per your request, I will only provide the Python code without any additional explanation. Here is the code based on the steps identified:

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: list) -> None:
        last_non_zero_found_at = 0
        for current in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[current] != 0:
                nums[last_non_zero_found_at], nums[current] = nums[current], nums[last_non_zero_found_at]
                last_non_zero_found_at += 1
```
