As per your request, here is the Python code based on the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Step 1: Define a list of sets, each set containing the letters of one row of the American keyboard.
        keyboard_rows = [
            set("qwertyuiop"),
            set("asdfghjkl"),
            set("zxcvbnm")
        ]
        
        # Step 2: Iterate through the list of words.
        # Step 3: For each word, check if all its letters belong to any one of the keyboard row sets.
        # Step 4: Collect words that meet the criteria into a result list.
        result = [word for word in words if any(set(word.lower()).issubset(row) for row in keyboard_rows)]
        
        # Step 5: Return the result list.
        return result
```

Please note that the `List` type hint should be imported from `typing` if you are using a version of Python that requires it (Python 3.8 and earlier). If you are using Python 3.9 or later, `list` can be used as a type hint directly.
