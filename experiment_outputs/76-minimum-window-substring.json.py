Based on the steps provided, here is the Python code for the `minWindow` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Create a hashmap to count the required frequency of characters in t.
        t_freq = {}
        for char in t:
            t_freq[char] = t_freq.get(char, 0) + 1
        
        # Step 2: Initialize variables for the window start, the number of characters matched, and the minimum window length.
        start = 0
        matched = 0
        min_length = float('inf')
        min_start = 0
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over s with an end pointer to expand the window.
        for end in range(len(s)):
            if s[end] in t_freq:
                # Step 4: Update the character frequency in the current window and the number of characters matched.
                t_freq[s[end]] -= 1
                if t_freq[s[end]] >= 0:
                    matched += 1
            
            # Step 5: While the current window contains all required characters, move the start pointer to shrink the window.
            while matched == len(t):
                if end - start + 1 < min_length:
                    # Step 6: Update the minimum window length and starting index when a smaller valid window is found.
                    min_length = end - start + 1
                    min_start = start
                
                if s[start] in t_freq:
                    t_freq[s[start]] += 1
                    if t_freq[s[start]] > 0:
                        matched -= 1
                start += 1
        
        # Step 7: Repeat steps 3 to 6 until the end of s is reached.
        # This is implicitly done by the for loop.
        
        # Step 8: Return the minimum window substring or an empty string if no valid window is found.
        return s[min_start:min_start + min_length] if min_length != float('inf') else ""
```

This code follows the steps provided to implement the sliding window algorithm for finding the minimum window substring that contains all the characters of string `t` in string `s`.
