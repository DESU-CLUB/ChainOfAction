Based on the steps provided, here is the Python code for the "Jump Game" problem using the function head you've given:

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        # 1: Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum reachable index.
        max_reach = 0
        
        # 2: Loop through each element in the array.
        for i, jump in enumerate(nums):
            # 3: If the current index is greater than the maximum reachable index, return false.
            if i > max_reach:
                return False
            
            # 4: Update the maximum reachable index if the current position allows reaching further.
            max_reach = max(max_reach, i + jump)
        
        # 5: Return true if the maximum reachable index is at least the last index of the array.
        return max_reach >= len(nums) - 1
```

Please replace `List[int]` with the appropriate import statement `from typing import List` at the beginning of your code file if you are using a version of Python that requires it.
