As per your request, here is the Python code based on the steps provided:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Initialize two pointers, one for string s and one for string t.
        pointer_s, pointer_t = 0, 0
        
        # Step 2: Iterate over string t using the pointer for t.
        while pointer_t < len(t):
            # Step 3: For each character in t, check if it matches the current character in s using the pointer for s.
            if s[pointer_s] == t[pointer_t]:
                # Step 4: If a match is found, move the pointer for s to the next character.
                pointer_s += 1
                # Step 5: If the pointer for s reaches the end of s, return true.
                if pointer_s == len(s):
                    return True
            # Move to the next character in t
            pointer_t += 1
        
        # Step 6: If the end of t is reached without the pointer for s reaching the end of s, return false.
        return pointer_s == len(s)
```

This code will check if `s` is a subsequence of `t` by iterating through `t` and matching characters to `s`. If all characters of `s` are found in `t` in order, the function will return `true`. If the end of `t` is reached without finding all characters of `s`, it will return `false`.
