0	001-two-sum	"Given an array of integers, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and 
you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]."	This Python script solves the Two Sum problem, a common task from LeetCode, where given an array of integers, you should return indices of two numbers, such that their sum equals a specific target. The given solution implements two methods, both fulfilling the task with different time and space complexities. The more efficient one is O(N) in time and space complexity, achieved by constructing a dictionary for efficient lookups of the complementary number. The less efficient one has O(N^2) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.

Output: 49"	"This Python file solves the 'Container With Most Water' problem from LeetCode. It finds the max possible area between two container lines on a 2D grid.

It does this by initializing two pointers at both ends of the array (which represents the vertical lines), then moves them inward. At each step, it calculates the area between the two lines and updates the maximum area found so far. The lower line's pointer is advanced to search for a potentially larger area. It ensures every possible area is computed and the largest area is found."
2	013-roman-to-integer	"description/

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. 
The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, 
the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to 
the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:
Input: ""III""
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: ""IV""
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: ""IX""
Output: 9

Example 4:
Input: ""LVIII""
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 5:
Input: ""MCMXCIV""
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4."	This script solves the problem of converting a roman numeral into an integer. It implements this by mapping each Roman numeral symbol to its corresponding integer value and iterating through the string from the end to the start. While iterating, it checks if the current value is less than the previous one, then subtracts it from the cumulative sum; otherwise, it adds it. This approach takes care of the rule where a smaller numeral appears before a larger one, representing a subtraction operation.
3	015-3sum	"Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0?
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]"	The python file solves the problem of finding unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero. It uses a two-pointer approach on a sorted version of the list. The function threeSum iterates over the list and for each element, it uses two pointers - 'start' and 'end'. It calculates the sum of the numbers at the current element, start pointer and end pointer. Depending on the sum, it either increases the start pointer or decreases the end pointer. Any triplet that sums to zero is added to the result.

The script defines a class, `ListNode`, for the linked list nodes and a function, `removeNthFromEnd`, for implementing the task. The `removeNthFromEnd` function employs a two-pointer approach to locate the n-th node from the end. 'p1' moves 'n' steps first and then both pointers move forward until 'p1' reaches the end. The n-th node is removed by modifying `p2.next` to point to `p2.next.next`, thus bypassing the n-th node."

The solution uses a stack data structure to match the brackets. It iterates through the input string, pushes any opening bracket onto the stack, and when a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the topmost stack element (using ""pop"") matches the closing bracket. If it doesn't, it returns 'False'. At the end, if the stack is empty, it returns 'True' indicating balanced parentheses."

It does this by initializing a method called mergeTwoLists with linked lists l1 and l2 as inputs. It conducts checks to see which list node has a smaller value. The node with the smaller value is then linked to the result of sequentially comparing and linking the next nodes. The process stops when either list runs out of nodes, returning the remaining nodes of the other list."
7	026-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array	"description/

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}"	This Python file solves the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place without allocating extra space. It implements a solution to a problem from LeetCode, where the function `removeDuplicates` manipulates the given array by comparing each element with its preceding one. If they are different, it replaces the next element of the preceding one with the current element. The function returns the count of unique elements found giving a new length of the array.

Example 2:
Input: haystack = ""aaaaa"", needle = ""bba""
Output: -1

Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf()."	This Python file solves the problem of determining the index of the first occurrence of a 'needle' string in a 'haystack' string. It implements the strStr() function, much like C's strstr() and Java's indexOf(). The function iterates through all possible substrings in the 'haystack', with the same length as the 'needle'. When it comes across an identical match to the 'needle', it returns the starting index. For empty 'needle', the function returns 0.

For every string in the list, it creates count of each character by treating each character as an 'a' indexed array. Later, this count array is appended to the dictionary. By doing this, all anagram strings end up in the same bucket (i.e., the same key-value pair in the dictionary). The final answer is the group of these values.

The function `spiralOrder` takes a matrix as input and returns a list of its elements in spiral order. It maintains four counters to track the current top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the matrix. It goes through the matrix's elements in a clockwise spiral direction based on these boundaries and appends the elements to the result list. For each full loop, the respective boundary counters are updated. This is repeated until all elements have been visited.

It solves the problem by checking each cell in the matrix; if a zero is found, it sets the first element of the corresponding row and column to zero.

It does this by creating a counter dictionary 'd' to keep track of the frequency of each song length modulo 60. Then, it iterates over the song lengths in 'time' and for each song, it increments count by the number of previously encountered songs that, when added to the current song, would result in a total duration divisible by 60. Finally, it increments the song length's frequency in 'd'.

It achieves this by using a while loop to traverse through each node in the binary tree. For each node, if the left child exists, it moves to the rightmost node of the left subtree. Then, it detaches the left subtree, merges the right subtree to the rightmost node of the left subtree, and replaces the right subtree with the detached left subtree. The loop continues until all nodes are visited, resulting in a flattened linked list.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n 
and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.
Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color 
(red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, 
right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  
If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Note:
You may only use constant extra space.
Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
Example:

Given the following perfect binary tree,

 / \  / \
4->5->6->7 -> NULL"	This Python script solves the problem of linking each node in a perfect binary tree to its next right node using minimal space. It first checks if the root exists, then calls a depth-first search (DFS) function, passing the root node. The DFS function links the current node to its next node, then recursively applies itself to the left and right children. This approach ensures each node correctly points to its next right node, or None if it doesn't exist.

Return 0 if the string is already balanced.

Example 1:
Input: s = ""QWER""
Output: 0

Explanation: s is already balanced.

Example 2:
Input: s = ""QQWE""
Output: 1

Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that ""RQWE"" (or ""QRWE"") is balanced.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""QQQW""
Output: 2

Explanation: We can replace the first ""QQ"" to ""ER"". 

Example 4:
Input: s = ""QQQQ""
Output: 3

Explanation: We can replace the last 3 'Q' to make s = ""QWER"".
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s.length is a multiple of 4
s contains only 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R'."	This Python file provides a solution for finding the minimum length of a substring needed to be replaced to balance a string consistent of 'Q', 'W', 'E', 'R' characters. The solution works by counting the occurrences of each character and iteratively removing characters from the start of the string until a balanced state is reached. The shortest balancing substring length is then returned.

Example 2:

Input: ""race a car""
Output: false"	This Python file contains a function that determines whether a given string is a palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case of the letters for validation. This problem is solved by utilizing two pointers (low, high) to scan the string from both ends. If the characters at both pointers are the same, the function shifts pointers towards the center. If it finds any mismatch, it returns False, signifying the string isn't a palindrome. If no mismatches found, returns True.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using 
extra memory?"	"This Python file solves a problem where you find the only single number in a list, where all other numbers appear twice. 

It solves the task by using the XOR bitwise operation on all numbers in the list. According to XOR properties, this operation between a number and itself results in 0, and the operation between any number and 0 results in the original number. Thus, duplicate items in the list cancel each other out, and you're left with the single number."

num + 1 or num + 2.

Return the two integers in any order. 

Example 1:

Explanation: For num + 1 = 9, the closest divisors are 3 & 3, for num + 2 = 10, 
the closest divisors are 2 & 5, hence 3 & 3 is chosen.

Example 2:
Input: num = 123

Constraints:
1 <= num <= 10^9"	The Python file solves the problem of finding the closest divisors of a number (num+1 or num+2). By starting from the square root of the input number and iterating downwards, it checks if either num+1 or num+2 is divisible by the current number. If so, it returns those two divisors. This approach uses the concept that factors of a number start to repeat after its square root, minimizing the search range and therefore the time complexity.

The script takes three integers, a, b, and c, and returns a string that contains at most 'a' occurrences of 'a', 'b' occurrences of 'b', and 'c' occurrences of 'c'.

The solution iteratively appends the most frequent character to the result string, without violating the happy string condition. It determines the maximum occurrence among 'a', 'b', and 'c' at each step and adjusts the counts. The process continues until no more characters can be appended. If no happy string can be formed, it returns an empty string."
102	141-linked-list-cycle	"description/

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?"	This Python code solves the problem of determining if a linked list has a cycle. It uses two pointers, 'slow' and 'fast'. The 'slow' pointer moves one step at a time while the 'fast' pointer moves two steps. If there is a cycle in the list, the 'fast' pointer will eventually catch up to the 'slow' pointer, identifying the cycle. This solution does not require any extra space, thereby adhering to the follow-up question.

It accomplishes this by iteratively adding numbers from the array to the current sum (`cur_sum`), tracking the minimum sum (`min_sum`). If `cur_sum` is less than `min_sum`, `min_sum` gets updated. The absolute value of `min_sum` plus 1 is returned as the minimum start value.

Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies 
--- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest

Output: 4
Explanation: ""burg"" is prefix of ""burger"" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

Example 2:
Input: sentence = ""this problem is an easy problem"", searchWord = ""pro""
Output: 2
Explanation: ""pro"" is prefix of ""problem"" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, 
but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.

Example 3:
Input: sentence = ""i am tired"", searchWord = ""you""
Output: -1
Explanation: ""you"" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.

Example 4:
Input: sentence = ""i use triple pillow"", searchWord = ""pill""
Output: 4

Example 5:
Input: sentence = ""hello from the other side"", searchWord = ""they""
Output: -1
 

Constraints:
1 <= sentence.length <= 100
1 <= searchWord.length <= 10
sentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
searchWord consists of lowercase English letters."	This Python file solves the problem of finding if a word occurs as a prefix in any of the words in a given sentence, and returning the index of the first word that meets the criteria. If there's no match, it returns -1. The solution preprocesses the sentence and the searchWord by adding a space at the beginning. It scans through the sentence character by character, increasing a word counter whenever a space is encountered. Simultaneously, it keeps track of the matched characters. If a complete match is found, it returns the word counter.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists of lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= s.length"	This Python file solves the problem of finding the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of a given string of length 'k'. The code does this by first defining the vowels. It maintains a current maximum ('cur_max') and overall maximum ('max_vowels') count of vowels within the range of 'k'. It iterates over the length of the string, updating 'cur_max' each time it encounters a vowel. If 'i' exceeds 'k', it subtracts one from 'cur_max' for the vowel 'k' places back. 'max_vowels' is updated with the maximum value of itself and 'cur_max'. This way, the program returns the maximum number of vowels in any 'k'-length substring.

Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going 
from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and 
the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic

The script performs a depth-first search on the tree, using an array to keep track of the occurrence of each digit in the current path. When a leaf node is reached, it checks if the path is pseudo-palindromic by examining whether at most one digit appears an odd number of times. This is done by iterating over the occurrence array and using a flag to indicate if an odd count has been found. If more than one odd count is found, the path is not pseudo-palindromic. The count of pseudo-palindromic paths is incremented accordingly. After each node, it performs backtracking to undo the changes to the occurrence array."

It solves this problem by using a stack and iterating through the input array. If the top of the stack is larger than the current number and the length of the stack and remaining array is larger than 'k', it pops the top of the stack.

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?"	"This Python file provides a solution for rotating arrays to the right by a specified non-negative steps 'k'. After rotation, the last 'k' elements of the array become the first elements and the remaining elements slide to the right.

The function utilizes a Python technique called list slicing. It modulates 'k' to fit the array length. Then, in a while-loop, it rotates elements by swapping values. This method accomplishes rotation manipulation in-place with O(1) extra space, meeting performance requirements."

Note:
Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be 
given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation 
of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. 
Therefore, in Example 3 above the input represents the signed integer -3.
 
Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?"	"The Python file contains a function that calculates the Hamming weight of a given integer, i.e., the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the number. 

To solve this, the function initializes a counter at zero. As long as the given number is not zero, it increments the counter and performs a bitwise AND operation between the number and one less than the number. This operation effectively flips the least significant '1' bit in the number to '0', gradually reducing the number to zero. The function then returns the counter value, which represents the number of '1' bits in the original number."

The problem lies in creating a new array twice the length of the original one, where the first half is the original array and the second half resembles the original array. The script resolves this by iterating through the original array and appending each element to the end of the array. This way, the array comprises the original elements two times.

The Python file solves the problem using depth-first-search (DFS) in a specific order. It goes through the binary tree from the top to bottom and from right to left. During the traversal, the module checks if the current level is equal to the size of the results array. If true, it appends the current node's value to the result array.

The solution develops an algorithm to accomplish this by initializing an empty linked list and a carry over value. Then, in a while loop, it adds corresponding digits from both input linked lists along with the carry value, stores the sum mod 10 in a new node, and updates the carry value.

The problem comes from Leetcode and involves removing all elements from a linked list that have a certain value. By establishing a dummy head for the linked list, the script iterates over each node. If the node's value equals the target value, the node is skipped (deleted), otherwise, the script moves to the next node.

Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7."	This Python file solves the problem of counting the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer, n. It does this using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm which effectively finds all prime numbers up to n by initially assuming every integer greater than 1 is prime, then iteratively marking non-prime numbers.

This Python file solves the problem of determining if two input strings are isomorphic - that is, if characters in one string can be swapped to get the other, without changing the order. It solves this by utilizing two dictionaries to keep track of the last seen indexes of given characters in both strings. If the last seen indexes for a character in both strings aren't the same, it returns False signifying that strings aren't isomorphic. If all characters pass this test, it returns True, indicating isomorphism.

The problem is from LeetCode (problem number 215 - 'Kth Largest Element in an Array'). To solve this, the code utilises Python's built-in sorted function to sort the input list `nums` in ascending order, then return the `-kth` element which translates to the `kth` largest number in the list.

180	232-implement-queue-using-stacks	"Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

Example:
MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();
queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false

Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, 
size, and 
is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by 
using a list or deque 
(double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be 
called on an empty queue)."	"The Python script implements a Queue data structure, using lists (acting as stacks) to emulate its typical operations; namely, push, pop, peek, and checking if the queue is empty. It adheres to the Queue's First-In-First-Out (FIFO) philosophy as opposed to the Stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) nature.

The solution maintains two stacks: stack1 to handle push, and stack2 for pop and peek operations. All elements are pushed into stack1. When a pop or peek operation is needed, elements from stack1 are transferred to stack2 and popped/peeked from there, maintaining the FIFO order. The empty function checks if both stacks are empty. The time complexity is O(1) while the space complexity is O(n)."

It provides an implementation of a method that determines if a linked list is a palindrome by first reversing the first half of the list, then comparing it with the second half. If all corresponding elements are the same, the linked list is a palindrome. It additionally provides helper methods for reversing a sublist and for calculating the length of the list. Efficient in both space and time complexity.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

It resolves this by defining a function within a class, `deleteNode()`, that takes a node as an argument. This function modifies the value of the target node to the next node's value and adjusts the next pointer to skip over the next node, effectively removing the target node from the linked list.

It iterates over 'nums' backwards, memoising the next greater element for each number. Then it iteratively check the next greatest from the current index to the end of the window frame. It appends the maximum element at each window frame to the 'res' list. The process is repeated as the window ""slides"" through the array. The function returns the 'res' list.

It does this by using an iterative approach where a temporary variable is used to swap the nodes. In case the linked list initially starts as 1->2->3->4, the function will return it as 2->1->4->3. Two alternative solutions are provided, one using a dummy variable to hold the value of the nodes while swapping, the other using recursion to achieve the swap.

You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?"	This Python file provides a solution to the problem of determining whether two input strings are anagrams of each other. It solves this problem by first checking the lengths of both strings. If they aren't equal, it directly returns `False`. It then uses a dictionary named `letters` in which it stores the frequency of each character from the first string. Afterwards, for each character in the second string, it checks if this character is present in `letters` and its frequency is greater than 0. If not, it returns `False`. Finally, the function returns `True`.

Note:
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only

An array `dp` is created where each index `i` stores the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i`. The script iterates from `4` to `n` and for each `i`, it checks all perfect squares less than or equal to `i` and updates `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value or `dp[i - (j*j)] + 1`.

This Python file solves the problem of reordering an array so that all zeros are moved to the end, while preserving the relative order of the non-zero numbers. It addresses this by iterating over the array and, for every non-zero number it finds, swapping its position with the current 'pos' position (start as zero).

The Python file solves the problem of finding the duplicate number in an array, where numbers can range from 1 to n. The solution makes use of Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm for loop detection by treating the numbers as linked node indices. Computing two pointers at different speeds helps detect the loop (duplicate number). After finding the place they meet, the algorithm retraces the steps from start to find the entry point of the loop (the duplicate number). This approach has less than O(n^2) time complexity, satisfying the problem constraints.

To resolve this, the solution uses two heaps, a min-heap and a max-heap, to store the data stream. The max-heap stores the smaller half of the numbers, while the min-heap stores the larger half. On this setting, the median is found quickly, being always at the root of the heaps. 

Upon adding a new number (addNum), it's pushed into the max-heap then the smallest element of the max-heap is transferred to the min-heap. If min-heap is larger, the smallest in min-heap is transferred back to max-heap. This process ensures heaps are balanced, holding the same number of elements, hence getting the median (findMedian) becomes an O(1) operation."

`deserialize` takes a comma-separated string and reconstructs the binary tree. It uses a helper function that recursively builds the tree by popping the first value of the list as the root node, and then creating the left and right sub-trees."

This Python file offers two solutions to the problem of finding the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. The first function, lengthOfLongestSubstring, operates with a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(min(m, n)). It uses a sliding window technique, maintaining a set of non-repeating characters. The second function, lengthOfLongestSubstring1, has similar time complexity but with a space complexity of O(k). It uses a dictionary to store each character's latest index. Thus, both functions efficiently solve the problem with respective strategies.

Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates 
that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. 
When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, 
those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.
The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]

It implements a solution class with methods for storing the original array, resetting the array to its original state, and shuffling the array. The shuffle function uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm, where for each position in the array, it selects a random element from the rest of the array (including itself) and swaps it. 

This method ensures all permutations are equally likely to be returned when the array is shuffled, fulfilling the problem's requirement."

String does not contain white spaces.
String contains only digits 0-9, [, - ,, ].
 
Example 1:
Given s = ""324"",
You should return a NestedInteger object which contains a single integer 324.

It solves it by defining an interface `NestedInteger` for creating nested lists and methods to manipulate the nested lists. It also has a `deserialize` method that iterates over the input string, building up a stack based on the characters it encounters. It creates an integer number when it hits a digit, initiates or adds an element to a NestedInteger list when it hits a bracket, and finally returns the last element when it encounters a closing bracket."

return 2.
Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters."	The Python file solves the problem of finding the first unique character in a string. It does this by iterating over the given string and storing each character and its count in a dictionary. Then, it iterates over the string once more to find the first character that appears only once (i.e., its count in the dictionary is one) and returns its index. If no such character exists, it returns -1, thereby offering an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n) and constant space complexity.

The problem is drawn from LeetCode and is about finding the difference between two strings where the second string is a shuffled version of the first, with an additional character inserted randomly. 

The solution uses Python's collections.Counter to create dictionaries of character counts for both strings. Then, it subtracts the 's' string count from 't' string count. The resulting dictionary contains the added character. The first element from the characters list of this dictionary is returned as it represents the character that was added."
230	392-is-subsequence	"Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. 
t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by 
deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions 
of the remaining characters. (ie, ""ace"" is a subsequence of ""abcde"" while ""aec"" is not).

Example 1:
s = ""abc"", t = ""ahbgdc""
Return true.

Example 2:
s = ""axc"", t = ""ahbgdc""

The problem is mainly based on string manipulation and can handle a string 't' up to a length of ~500,000 and a short string 's' up to length of 100. 

This problem is solved by iterating over each character 'c' in the string 't'. If 'c' matches the character at the current index in 's', it increments the index. When the index length matches the length of 's', it concludes 's' is a subsequence of 't' i.e., it successfully traversed all characters in 's'. If not, 's' is not a subsequence of 't'."

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those 
repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].

s = ""3[a2[c]]"", return ""accaccacc"".
s = ""2[abc]3[cd]ef"", return ""abcabccdcdcdef""."	This Python file solves the problem of decoding encoded strings. The string decoding is based on a specific format: a number followed by a string in square brackets, where the string needs to be repeated according to the number. It solves this problem by using a stack data structure. Current string and number are stored on the stack whenever an opening bracket is encountered and popped from stack when a closing bracket is found. The string is decoded by repeating the bracket-enclosed string according to the multipler number.

The Python script is for the 'Remove K Digits' problem where it aims to remove 'k' digits from a given non-negative integer (in string format), such that the resulting number is smallest possible. It solves this by iterating over each digit in the number string, using a stack to store and remove characters to achieve the smallest possible result. We pop the stack (remove a digit) when we encounter a digit smaller than the last appended one. The script also handles test cases with leading zeros and equal num, k values.

It uses a binary search for the possible range of sums, applying a helper function that checks if it's possible to split the list with a sum not larger than the mid-value. If a division is possible, it narrows the search towards the smaller sum; else, it adjusts the search towards the larger sum.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of 
the first level of the list.

Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:
  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL

Example 3:
Input: head = []

How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:
We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:

The serialization of each level is as follows:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]

To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper 
node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]

It does this through a Depth First Search approach that recursively checks all individual paths. The `helper` method is used to explore all the routes from the root node, summing node values, and comparing it to the target value. If the sum equals the target, the path is marked valid and added to the result. It also keeps track of the sum at each step and subtracts the count if no other paths lead to the target sum.

""bbaA"" is also a valid answer, but ""Aabb"" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters."	This Python script solves the problem of sorting characters in a string based on their frequency. It imports the collections Python library and then uses it to count the frequency of each character in the input string. It then creates a list of tuples where each tuple comprises a character and its count. Then it sorts this list in descending order based on the count. Finally, it creates a new string by multiplying each character by its count and joining them together. The final string is returned as output.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [-2,-1], nums3 = [-1,2], nums4 = [0,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The two tuples are:
1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> nums1[0] + nums2[0] + nums3[0] + nums4[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0

The solution uses a hash map named 'cur_sum' to store the sum of pair values from the first two arrays as keys and their frequency as values. It then iterates through each possible pair in the remaining two arrays, finding their sum and checking in 'cur_sum' for the complement. If found, it adds to the total count. The result returned is the total count of such tuples."

Explanation: It's the substring ""ab"" twice.

Example 2:
Input: ""aba""
Output: False

Example 3:
Input: ""abcabcabcabc""
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring ""abc"" four times. (And the substring ""abcabc"" twice.)"	This Python file solves the problem of determining if a string can be constructed by repeating a substring from it multiple times. It does this by concatenating the original string to itself to form a new one, then eliminates the first and last character of the new string. By checking if the original string exists inside this edited version, it verifies if a repeated pattern exists or not. It leverages Python's in-built string comparison features to accomplish this, offering a solution with time and space complexity of O(N).

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different."	"The Python file solves the problem of calculating the Hamming distance between two integers, which is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

It solves this by taking two integers as inputs and applying a bitwise XOR operation on them. This operation results in a binary number where each '1' denotes a position where the original integer bits are different. The program then iterates over each bit in this binary number, increments a counter for each '1' it encounters, and finally, returns this count as the Hamming distance."

The island doesn't have ""lakes"" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). 
One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. 
Determine the perimeter of the island.

Output: 16"	"Problem: Given a 2D grid representing an island (1s) and water (0s), the task is to calculate the island's perimeter.

Solution: The `islandPerimeter` function solves this by iterating through each cell in the grid. When it encounters a '1', it incrementally adds 4 to the perimeter. If the cell is next to another '1' cell horizontally or vertically, it deducts 2 for each neighboring cell from the perimeter. This method correctly accounts for shared edges between adjacent land cells."

You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0."	"This Python file solves the problem of finding the binary complement of any positive integer. The problem guarantees no leading zeros in the binary representation.

The solution adopts a strategy of converting the input number to binary using Python's bin() function, removing the '0b' prefix, and flipping all the bits (i.e., changing 1s to 0s and vice versa). This is achieved with a list comprehension inside the join() function to iterate over each bit in the binary string.

Finally, the binary complement string is converted back to a decimal integer using Python's int() function with base 2. This result, the binary complement, gets returned as the solution."

It achieves this by checking each word to see if all its letters are in the same set of a predefined list representing the three rows of a keyboard. This is done through two methods: 'findWords' and 'findWordsUsingDict'.

This Python file solves the problem of finding the maximum length of a contiguous subarray in a binary array that has an equal number of 0s and 1s. It employs a hashmap to track the net count of 1s and 0s. If a match is found in the hashmap, it computes the length between current and previous indices and compares it with the current maximum length. If the count is not present in the hashmap, it adds the current index. This approach optimizes the traditional exhaustive search method.

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while 
still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:

"This Python file solves the problem of reversing the order of characters in each word of a sentence, whilst maintaining the original sentence's word order and whitespaces. This problem is better identified with the given LeetCode link.

The provided Python script utilizes the Python slice operation to solve this problem. It first reverses the given sentence, then splits it into independent words. Through iterating over these words in reverse order, it reconstructs the sentence with its words reversed, therefore giving the desired output."

Example 1:

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping."	"This Python file solves the problem of merging overlapping intervals given in a list. The problem presents situational occurrences where ranges overlap and require merging to simplify data representation.

The program tackles this by first sorting the intervals based on the start times (x[0]). Secondly, it initiates a loop through the sorted intervals and adds them to a new list (merged) if they don't overlap with the last interval in the new list. If an overlap is detected, it merges the overlapping intervals by changing the end time of the last interval in the new list to the maximum end time between the two intervals."

The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7]."	This Python file solves the problem of finding the total number of continuous subarrays in a given list whose sum equals a specified integer (k). It uses a dictionary to keep track of the sums it has encountered. For each number in the list, it adds it to the running sum. If the difference between the running sum and k exists in the dictionary, it increments the count by the frequency of that sum. The running sum is then added to the dictionary if it doesn't exist or its frequency is incremented.

n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000]."	"This Python file solves the problem of maximizing the sum of pairs' smallest elements in an array. 

It solves this by grouping the integers in pairs in such a way that the sum of the smallest integers in every pair is as large as possible. The function `arrayPairSum` sorts the input list `nums`, and then sums every second number (smallest of each pair) using Python's slice notation `::2`.

Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees."	This Python script solves the problem of merging two binary trees into a single binary tree. It addresses the challenge by adding the value of overlapping nodes and using the non-null node when there are no overlaps. It implements a recursive strategy, starting from the root nodes of the two input trees. In cases where a node is null in either tree, the respective node from the other tree is returned. Else, the node values are added together. This process is recursively repeated for the left and right child nodes.

Afterwards, it iterates through the count dictionary, decrementing idle slots by the minimum between the maximum frequency achieved minus one and the frequency of the current task. If idle slots are still positive, it means there are still idle intervals left, so it adds those to the total length of tasks; otherwise, it just returns the length of tasks.

Using the 'Binary Search' algorithm, it effectively halves the search space at each step by comparing the target with the middle element. If the target matches, it returns the index. If the target is greater, it continues the search on the right half, otherwise on the left. If the target is not found, it returns -1.
300	707-design-linked-list	"Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use the singly linked list or the doubly linked list. 
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and 
next is a pointer/reference to the next node. If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more 
attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement these functions in your linked list class:
get(index) : Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
addAtHead(val) : Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, 
                the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
addAtTail(val) : Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list.
addAtIndex(index, val) : Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. If index equals to the 
                        length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater 
                        than the length, the node will not be inserted.
deleteAtIndex(index) : Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

linkedList.addAtTail(3);
linkedList.addAtIndex(1, 2);  // linked list becomes 1->2->3
linkedList.get(1);            // returns 2

The problem it solves is converting all uppercase characters in a string to lowercase without using built-in string methods.

transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for 
each transaction.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously 
(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2

Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email 
that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different 
people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their 
accounts definitely have the same name.
After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, 
and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

Example 1:

[""Mary"", ""mary@mail.com""]]

Explanation: 
The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email ""johnsmith@mail.com"".
The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.

The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10].
The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30]."	This Python file solves the problem of merging multiple accounts linked through common email addresses. Using a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure, it identifies accounts that belong to the same person by finding common emails. It stores emails as keys in a dictionary, mapping to account indices. If the same email appears in different accounts, it merges these accounts using the union method of DSU. The solution organizes emails for each individual into sorted sets for easier access and returns a list of all grouped accounts.

Given a coordinate and a new color, the script changes the color of all pixels connected to the starting pixel that have the same initial color. The problem is solved by defining a depth-first search (DFS) function that recursively checks and colors all 4-directionally adjacent pixels, and invokes it using the given coordinates. This process continues until all eligible pixels are colored with the new value.

The graph looks like this:

The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes n will be in range [1, 100], with nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
The size of flights will be in range [0, n * (n - 1) / 2].
The format of each flight will be (src, dst, price).
The price of each flight will be in the range [1, 10000].
k is in the range of [0, n - 1].
There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles."	"This Python file solves the problem of finding the cheapest flight cost from a starting city to a destination city with up to 'k' stops, as outlined on the leetcode problem https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/

It implements Dijkstra's algorithm, by creating a priority queue storing tuples of cost, current city, and number of stops. If the current city is the destination, the cost is returned. If there are remaining stops, neighboring cities are pushed into the queue. If no route is found, it returns -1.

Further, it utilises a helper function to create a dictionary that maps each city to its adjacent cities and the cost to reach them, using the given list of flight routes."

A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 
'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.

Example 1:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'

Note:
A and B will have length at most 100."	"This Python file solves the problem of determining if a string can be rotated to match another string. It takes two inputs, string A and string B, performs shifts on string A, and checks if it can become string B.

The method `rotateString`, compares the lengths of A and B, returns false if they aren't equal. If they are equal, it concatenates A with itself and checks if B is a substring. If it is, it implies we can rotate A to obtain B. Thus, it solves the string rotation problem efficiently."
318	804-unique-morse-code-words	"International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, 
as follows: ""a"" maps to "".-"", ""b"" maps to ""-..."", ""c"" maps to ""-.-."", and so on.
For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:

["".-"",""-..."",""-.-."",""-.."",""."",""..-."",""--."",""...."","".."","".---"",""-.-"","".-.."",""--"",""-."",""---"","".--."",""--.-"",
"".-."",""..."",""-"",""..-"",""...-"","".--"",""-..-"",""-.--"",""--..""]
Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. 
For example, ""cab"" can be written as ""-.-.-....-"", (which is the concatenation ""-.-."" + ""-..."" + "".-""). 
We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.
Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

Example:

319	819_most_common_word	"Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the 
list of banned words.  It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and 
that the answer is unique.
Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation.  
Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive.  The answer is in lowercase.

Example:
Input: 
paragraph = ""Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.""
banned = [""hit""]
Output: ""ball""

Explanation: 
""hit"" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
""ball"" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as ""ball,""), 
and that ""hit"" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
 

Note:
1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
1 <= banned.length <= 100.
1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph may have uppercase symbols,

The problem is solved by traversing the string twice. On the first move, it runs left to right, recording distances from the specified character. Then, it traverses from right to left updating the previous distances if it encounters a shorter distance. This approach effectively tracks the nearest occurrence of the character in both directions.

If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append ""ma"" to the end of the word.
For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add ""ma"".
For example, the word ""goat"" becomes ""oatgma"".

323	832-flipping-an-image	"Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.
To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].
To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

Example 1:

The transpose of a matrix essentially 'flips' the matrix over its main diagonal, switching the positions of its row and column indices. The problem it solves is from LeetCode, specifically problem number 867, which requires the transposition of input matrices.

The script first calculates the length of the decoded string, without actually decoding it, by iterating over the encoded string. If a digit is encountered, the size of the decoded string is multiplied by this digit, and if it's a letter, the size is incremented by one.

Then it iteratively reduces the size based on the character in the reversed encoded string until the K%size is zero. At this point, it returns the current character, which is the K-th letter in the decoded string."

The program uses the two-pointer approach on the sorted list of people's weights. By initiating one pointer at the beginning and another at the end of the list, the program checks if the sum of the two weights is within the limit. If true, it incrementally moves the first pointer forward because these two persons can share a boat. Regardless, it always moves the end pointer backwards, indicating one person or a pair has been assigned a boat. This process continues until the pointers meet, representing everyone has a boat. Finally, the number of required boats is returned."

339	9-palindrome-number	"description/

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same 
backward as forward.

Example 1:
Input: 121
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. 
Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Follow up:
Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?"	This Python file defines a solution for determining if a given integer is a palindrome. The function `isPalindrome` works by checking if the integer is negative or ends with a zero. If it does, it returns `False` as these cannot be palindromes. It then reverses the integer and compares it with the original value, returning `True` only if they match. An alternative function uses similar logic but handles odd-length integers optimally. The key approach in both functions is modulo and integer division to reverse the digits.

This is achieved by iterating through the list and checking if each number is divisible by two (even).

Thus, ensuring all even numbers are placed before odd numbers while maintaining their original order."
341	909-snakes-and-ladders	"On an N x N board, the numbers from 1 to N*N are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, 
and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:
You start on square 1 of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).  Each move, starting from square x, 
consists of the following:
You choose a destination square S with number x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, or x+6, provided this number is <= N*N.
(This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, 
regardless of the size of the board.)
If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to S.
A board square on row r and column c has a ""snake or ladder"" if board[r][c] != -1.  
The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c].
Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start 
of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and 
on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, 
because you do not continue moving to `4`.)
Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: [
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].
You decide to move to square 2, and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.
You then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
It can be shown that you need at least 4 moves to reach the N*N-th square, so the answer is 4.

Note:
2 <= board.length = board[0].length <= 20
board[i][j] is between 1 and N*N or is equal to -1.
The board square with number 1 has no snake or ladder.
The board square with number N*N has no snake or ladder."	This script solves the Snakes and Ladders problem from LeetCode by implementing a breath-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS traverses the game board, represented as a 2-dimensional list, using a queue for possible spaces to move and a set for visited spaces. For each iteration, it simulates a dice roll (1-6 spaces) and follows any ladder or snake encountered. It keeps track of the minimum moves to reach the end of the board. If the end can't be reached, it returns -1.

Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with '0'. We cannot ignore a zero when we face it while decoding. So, each '0' should be part of ""10"" --> 'J' or ""20"" --> 'T'.

The problem is a LeetCode algorithm challenge named 'Decode Ways'. It uses a dynamic programming approach where the input is a string of digits, and the output is the total number of possible decodings.

The algorithm works by initializing a dynamic programming list(`dp`) with size more than the string length. At every index, it first checks if the current digit is not '0', it adds the previous dp's value. Then, if the current and previous digits make a valid 2-digit number (between 10 to 26), it adds the value from the dp two places back. In the end, it returns the last dp value.

It uses a two-pointer approach, where one starts at the beginning and the other at the end of the string. If it encounters a non-alpha character, it skips it. When it encounters a character, it swaps the positions. The process continues until it has traversed the whole string. This approach efficiently reverses the strings while keeping the position of non-alphabetical characters intact.

element of nums[i] is nums[(i - 1 + n) % n].
A subarray may only include each element of the fixed buffer nums at most once.

Solution:
There two cases:
1. When max sub array is in the middle. 
2. When max sub array = prefix + suffix
                      = total sum - middle sub array (min sub array)
Edge case: If all items are negative."	This Python file solves the problem of finding the maximum sum of a circular subarray. This problem is generally encountered in competitive programming and algorithm design, often on platforms like LeetCode. The solution uses the Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray sum with slight modifications to account for the circular nature of the array. The program iterates over the list of numbers, calculating the maximum subarray sum, minimum subarray sum, and total sum. It then returns the maximum between max_sum and (total - min_sum), covering both scenarios where the maximum subarray is in the middle or comprises the prefix + suffix of the circular array.

It uses a simple for loop where it iterates over odd indices of the given list and if any even number appears at an odd index, it swaps it with the next odd number appearing at an even index. This way, the list gets sorted according to the requirement.

For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.
Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.

same address without dots in the local name.  For example, ""alice.z@leetcode.com"" and ""alicez@leetcode.com"" forward to the same email address.  
(Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)
If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered, f
or example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)
It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails?

1 <= emails.length <= 100
Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character."	This Python file solves the problem of counting the number of unique email addresses in a given list of emails. It implements this by defining a method that processes each email address in the list. For each email, it splits into local and domain parts then discards any characters after a '+' and removes all '.' characters in the local part. Finally, it adds the processed email address to a set to ensure uniqueness, and the size of this set is returned, representing the count of unique emails.

The script implements a function called `isUnivalTree`, which uses Breadth-first Search (BFS) approach to traverse all nodes. It accomplished this by storing all nodes in a queue (`q`) and compares the value of each node (`temp.val`) with the root's value (`val`).

356	973-k-closest-points-to-origin	"Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on 
the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance 
(i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique 
(except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, 
so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

Constraints:
1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
-104 < xi, yi < 104"	"The Python file is a solution to the problem ""973 - K Closest Points to Origin"" from LeetCode. The problem requires finding K points from an array that are closest to the origin in a 2D space.

The solution uses a heap data structure to store the first K points along with their Euclidean distance from the origin. It then iterates over the remaining points, calculating their distances, and maintains the heap size to K by pushing new distances to the heap and popping out the largest one. At the end, it returns the K points with the smallest distances. The time complexity is O(NlogK), where N is the number of points."

A is sorted in non-decreasing order."	This Python file solves the problem of returning the squares of each number from a sorted list, also in sorted non-decreasing order. It does this by first determining the starting point in the list where numbers turn nonnegative. Then it efficiently merges the squares of negative and nonnegative numbers using two pointers. The result is a list of the squares of each number in non-decreasing order.

The problem is solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) with the help of a stack data structure. It traverses through the binary tree with a condition enforced to check the BST rules. If at any node, the condition fails, it immediately returns False, indicating the tree is not a BST. If the traversal completes successfully, it confirms the tree is a valid BST."

It solves the problem of retrieving string values based on a combination of string keys and timestamps, returning either the latest value before the given timestamp or an empty string if no such value exists. It utilizes binary search for efficient retrieval. In 'set', it saves the key, value and timestamp. In 'get', it returns the value for a key-timestamp pair. It manages keys and their values (timestamped) using a dictionary.
360	986-interval-list-intersections	"Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.
Return the intersection of these two interval lists.
(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x 
with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers 
that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  
For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

Example 1:
Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
Reminder: The inputs and the desired output are lists of Interval objects, and not arrays or lists.

0 <= A.length < 1000
0 <= B.length < 1000
0 <= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end < 10^9"	This Python file solves the problem of finding intersections between a pair of interval lists. It iterates over both lists simultaneously using two indices. It identifies the maximum start point and minimum end point for each pair of intervals. If the start point is less than or equal to the end point, it means an intersection is present, and it's added to the results list. The interval with the smallest endpoint is then removed to proceed with the next pair.

we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing Y coordinates).
If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.
Return an list of non-empty reports in order of X coordinate.  Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

Example 1:
Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation: 
Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).

Example 2:

The problem is from leetcode's challenge, where it deals with an array-form of a non-negative integer X and an integer K, returning the array-form of the sum of X and K. The script uses a while loop to add K to the end digit of the array-form of X (from right to left). If the sum of a digit and K is 10 or greater, it carries the value to the next digit. If K is still greater than 0 when the index reaches the first digit, it inserts the remaining K at the front. This way it calculates the sum in array form.
